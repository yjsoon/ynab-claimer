# Agent Instructions

Guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Sensitive Data

**DO NOT commit or expose:**
- Actual Cloudflare Worker URLs (use `https://receipts.yourdomain.com` as placeholder)
- YNAB API keys or budget IDs
- Any values from `.env`

The `.env` file contains secrets. When writing documentation or examples, always use placeholders.

## Project Structure

- `upload-app/` - Cloudflare Worker for receipt uploads
- `scripts/` - Local automation scripts for Volopay and Gmail receipt export
- `.claude/skills/claims/SKILL.md` - Claude Code skill for processing claims
- `.claude/skills/ride-gmail-receipts/SKILL.md` - Skill for exporting Grab and Gojek ride receipts from Gmail using `gog`
- `.claude/skills/claim-invoices/SKILL.md` - Skill for generating Xero draft bills from ready-to-claim items (Invoices tab)
- `.agents/skills/ride-gmail-receipts/SKILL.md` - Agent mirror of the ride Gmail receipt export skill
- `.agents/skills/claim-invoices/SKILL.md` - Agent mirror of the claim-invoices skill
- `upload-app/worker/xero.ts` - Xero OAuth + bill creation/attachment for the Invoices tab
- `.env` - Local config (gitignored)
- `.env.example` - Template with placeholders (safe to commit)

## Configuration

Local config lives in `.env` (gitignored); `.env.example` is the committed template. Required variables:

- `YNAB_API_KEY` — from https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer
- `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` — from the YNAB URL when viewing the budget
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — for receipt amount tagging
- `GEMINI_MODEL` — optional override (worker default: `gemini-3-flash-preview`)
- `R2_WORKER_URL` — deployed receipt-upload worker URL
- `R2_PASSWORD` — receipt worker auth token (must match the worker's `AUTH_PASSWORD` secret)
- `VOLOPAY_URL` — your company's Volopay subdomain

## Claims Processing

The claims skill at `.claude/skills/claims/SKILL.md` handles matching YNAB transactions with uploaded receipts.

Before doing manual claim/receipt matching, run the auto-link helper from `scripts/`:

```bash
cd scripts
npm run link:matches
```

This is a dry run. Always show the full dry-run output to the user for verification before applying anything, including each clear match itemised one by one. If it reports clear one-to-one matches and the user confirms they should be marked as done, apply them with:

```bash
npm run link:matches -- --apply
```

The helper only writes receipt link metadata through `PATCH /receipt/:key/link`; it does not delete receipts, update YNAB memos, or submit Volopay claims. Default matching is intentionally conservative: exact receipt date plus amount within 1 cent, with ambiguous candidates skipped. Do not apply `--near-days` or `--allow-upload-date` unless the user explicitly asks for looser matching. Always report ambiguous skipped candidates back to the user and ask which receipt, if any, should be linked.

The web UI section formerly called "Already Linked" is "Ready to Claim". It includes normal claim-receipt links and receipts the user has explicitly marked ready even when no matching YNAB TODO claim is visible. Ready-only receipts use synthetic link IDs prefixed with `receipt-ready:`. Treat those as intentional ready markers, not broken YNAB links.

The claims skill auto-invokes when the user mentions claims, expenses, reimbursements, receipts, or YNAB TODOs.

## YNAB Memo Convention

- `TODO: <description>` — pending claim
- `CLAIMED: <description>` — processed claim

## Volopay Claim Submission

Submit a single claim to Volopay with the Playwright automation in `scripts/`:

```bash
cd scripts
npm run submit -- claim.json
```

`volopay-submit.ts` reads the claim JSON from the file argument (or stdin), logs into Volopay (using `VOLOPAY_URL`), fills the Create-claim form, then **pauses for manual review** — you click Continue and close the browser to finish. It never auto-submits.

The claim JSON requires these fields: `merchant`, `amount`, `date`, `memo`, `xeroCategory`, `xeroTaxCode`, `receiptPath`. Use the rules below to fill `xeroTaxCode` and `xeroCategory`.

### Tax Code Rules (CRITICAL)

**Only use `INPUTY24` when the receipt shows an explicit GST line item. Never assume GST.**

| Condition | Tax Code |
| :---- | :---- |
| Receipt shows a GST amount | `INPUTY24:Standard-Rated Purchases` |
| No GST + foreign currency | `OPINPUT:Out Of Scope Purchases` |
| No GST + SGD | `NRINPUT:Purchases from Non-GST Registered Suppliers` |

### Category Mappings

**Volopay**: Software, Equipment & hardware, Entertainment

**Xero**:
- Software → Computer Software (463)
- IMDA VIBE / "for class" → Cost of Sales (320)
- Hardware → Computer Hardware & Accessories (464)

## Invoices (Xero Claim Bills)

An alternative to Volopay: the receipts.soon.sg **Invoices** tab turns ready-to-claim
items into monthly DRAFT bills in Xero (payee "Soon Yin Jie"), split into GST /
non-GST / transport, with receipts attached. After a push, receipts are tagged
`xeroInvoiceId` (so they drop off the tab) and the linked YNAB `TODO:` memos become
`CLAIMED:`.

- Worker: `upload-app/worker/xero.ts` (OAuth 2.0 over raw fetch, refresh-token
  rotation in the `XERO_TOKENS` KV namespace, bill creation + attachments) and the
  `/xero/*` routes in `upload-app/worker/index.ts`.
- UI: `upload-app/src/{index.html,main.js,style.css}` (the Invoices tab + editor).
- Config: `wrangler.toml` (`XERO_TOKENS` KV + `XERO_SCOPES` / `XERO_INPUT_TAXTYPE`
  vars); secrets `XERO_CLIENT_ID` / `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET` (same Xero app as the local
  `xero/` project). Local secrets template: `upload-app/.dev.vars.example`.

Account/tax-code rules match the Volopay section above (amounts are tax-inclusive
SGD; `INPUTY24` only when the receipt shows explicit GST). Xero attachment caps
(3 MB/file, 10/bill) are handled by merging receipts into chunked combined PDFs;
HEIC/WEBP can't be embedded and are flagged for manual upload. Full setup and usage:
`.claude/skills/claim-invoices/SKILL.md`. Do not deploy to the live worker without
the user's go-ahead.

## Gmail Receipt Export

Use the ride Gmail receipt export skill when the user needs missing Grab or Gojek ride receipts from Gmail. It uses `gog` against `yjsoon@gmail.com`, decodes the receipt HTML, and renders a clean PDF with Playwright:

```bash
cd scripts
npm run export:grab -- --since-last-exported --label-exported --max 20
npm run export:gojek -- --since-last-exported --label-exported --max 20
```

By default, repeat exports should start after the newest provider receipt already labelled `exported`; add `--label-exported` only after a PDF has rendered successfully. GrabFood / Grab Food receipts are ignored unless the user explicitly asks for food claims. Generated PDFs go to `~/Downloads` by default and are named `grab_YYYY-MM-DD_AMOUNT.pdf` or `gojek_YYYY-MM-DD_AMOUNT.pdf`. Do not commit exported receipt PDFs. Use them for the receipt uploader or claim processing flow.

### API Authentication

All receipt worker endpoints require the `X-Auth-Token` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $R2_PASSWORD" "https://receipts.yourdomain.com/list"
```

The password is stored in `.env` as `R2_PASSWORD` and must match the worker's `AUTH_PASSWORD` secret.

### Gemini Amount Tagging

Receipt amount tagging uses Google Gemini via Worker secret `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

- Default model: `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Optional override: Worker secret `GEMINI_MODEL`
- Batch backfill endpoint: `POST /amount-tags/pending?limit=3`
- Manual receipt date override endpoint: `PATCH /receipt/:key/receipt-date`
- Gemini also stores best-effort `taggedVendor` and `taggedPurpose` labels per receipt
- For USD receipts, store SGD approximations:
  - day-rate conversion
  - day-rate conversion plus 3.25%

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Auth header name**: Use `X-Auth-Token`, not `Authorization` or `X-Auth-Password`
2. **Worker URL**: Read from `.env` - don't hardcode; user may have custom domain
3. **YNAB amounts**: In milliunits - divide by 1000 for actual dollars
4. **Transfer duplicates**: Filter for `amount < 0` to avoid counting transfers twice
5. **Gemini model name**: Use `gemini-3-flash-preview` (hyphenated), not dotted/underscored variants
